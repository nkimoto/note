summary: I start my blog to raise my English skills up.
---

Today, I start blogging in English to improve my English skills and output my daily thoughts.  
As the first article, I answered some simple questions.

## Who am I?
I'm a 25 year-old Japanese person working as a data scientist in a consulting company.  
I have strong interest in bioinformatics and computational biology.  
I like thinking about the fusion of  genomics and biology with IT technology.


## Why I start blogging?
For a long time, I've been thinking that I want to talk with foreigner because in Japan, bioinformatics community is too small and it's hard to learn this area deeply.  
Recently I met my cousin who can speak English fluently (because he lived from 3 year-old), so I decided to learn from him.  
I write this blog as a means of learning English writing skills.   

## What is my purpose?
My goals are the following:

1. To be able to output what I learned
2. To be able to answer the job offer call

### To be able to output what I learned 
My final goal is to create a lecture video in English.  
I like learning bioinformatics and I imagine something like "OMGenomics" youtube channel.
This channel expands entrance to this field.

### To be able to answer the job offer call
I often give a call through Linkedin in English, but I can't speak English well, so, I can't communicate with the person who called me.
I think this is an oppotunity lost, so I want to practice natural conversations.

## How this blog is built?

This blog is built by [vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/).
VuePress is built on VueJS and will convert markdown files to HTML web pages.
Like VueJS, its tooling is friendly and the documentation is awesome.

Actually, I already have my [blog](https://www.kimoton.com/) which I write in Japanese. But this blog is hosted by a company, so it costs me a little money.
It doesn't cost anything to host a static website using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
